<h2>How to Choose the Best PEO for Dentists</h2>
<h3>Identify Your Dental Practice’s Needs</h3>
<p>No two dental practices are alike. Consider your headcount, services offered, growth ambitions, and unique pain points: do you need support with industry-specific regulations (like OSHA/HIPAA), better benefits, or more reliable payroll?</p>
<p>Jot down essentials and ""nice-to-haves""—this will clarify which dental PEO is the best fit.</p>

<h3>Evaluate Healthcare-Specific Services</h3>
<p>Some PEOs offer extras like industry compliance tracking, healthcare credentialing, or support for teledentistry—key for modern dental offices.</p>
<p>Ask about features for medical/dental benefits, insurance administration, OSHA/CDC tracking, and staff credential management. Pick a PEO whose services align with dental best practices.</p>

<h3>Check Compliance and Risk Management Expertise</h3>
<p>Dental practices face frequent regulatory and insurance changes—choose a PEO adept at OSHA, HIPAA, labor law, and dental license verification. Ask about audit support and whether they work with dental legal experts.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> A PEO with real healthcare experience is essential for lowering your risk.</p>

<h3>Test Software Usability for Dental Teams</h3>
<p>Your staff shouldn’t waste time learning clunky interfaces. Demand a product demo, check onboarding flows, and ensure the self-service portal is intuitive for both clinical and administrative staff.</p>
<p>If you use dental management software, check available integrations—saving precious admin hours every week.</p>

<h3>Consider Support and Dental Industry Reputation</h3>
<p>Fast, industry-savvy support makes a world of difference when patient care or compliance is on the line. Look for proven references from other dental practices and check reviews specific to the dental industry.</p>

<h3>Compare Pricing and Watch for Hidden Costs</h3>
<p>PEO pricing varies by staff size, benefits selected, and services covered. Read the fine print: ask for itemized quotes, and clarify costs if you grow, shrink, or change benefit elections mid-year.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The right PEO should save your practice money and stress in the long run—get all details up front.</p>

<h3>Think About Scalability and Easy Transitions</h3>
<p>Your practice will change as you acquire, merge, or add locations. Choose a dental PEO that can scale with you and let you exit smoothly if you bring HR back in-house or switch providers.</p>

<h2>PEO Pricing for Dental Practices</h2>
<p>Sticker shock is common the first time dental practice owners research PEO pricing. Generally, you’ll see per-employee-per-month models or a percentage of payroll. Pricing depends on how many staff you have and which services your practice requires.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at typical dental PEO costs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Provider</th><th>Pricing Model</th><th>Typical Cost</th><th>Setup Fees</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Multiplier</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$300–$400</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remofirst</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$199–$349</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remote</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$299–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Justworks</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$59–$99</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paychex</td><td>Custom quote</td><td>$39–$200</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rippling</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$35–$80 (Core HR only)</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deel</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$49–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Velocity global</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$300–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oyster</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$399–$699</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thera</td><td>Custom quote</td><td>Contact for pricing</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Services like OSHA, HIPAA, and dental benefit management may increase fees, but they’re worth it for compliance and staff satisfaction. Always ask for a custom quote that reflects your practice size, roles, and selected benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Value matters more than the cheapest price—invest in a PEO that prevents compliance issues, protects your reputation, and keeps staff happy.</p>

<h2>PEO Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory for Dental Offices</h2>
<p>Using a PEO gives dental practices powerful protection but also comes with responsibilities. Dental PEOs typically operate under a “co-employment” model, sharing HR, tax filing, and benefits duties while the practice maintains clinical supervision and direction.</p>
<p>The right dental PEO will be experienced with federal/state employment law, labor board requirements, and industry bodies like OSHA and the ADA. Ask to see PEO accreditations: ESAC, CPEO, and dental-specific endorsements are strong quality signals.</p>
<p>Your PEO can help with credential management, workers’ compensation, anti-harassment training, and keeping up with ever-changing OSHA/HIPAA rules. For practices with multi-location or international hiring, top providers like Multiplier and Remote minimize legal exposure and paperwork risk.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Only consider PEOs with a track record serving dental or healthcare clients. Niche expertise is crucial for handling day-to-day issues and complex audits.</p>
